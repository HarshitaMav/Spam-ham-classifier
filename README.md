# About the project
We used previously collected data in order to train the model and predicted the category for new incoming emails. 
Here we used the labelled dataset this helped in understanding the importance of tagging the data in right way.
This process can help a lot of other people who are receiving the same kind of email but not aware of what spam is. Sometimes wrong spam tag can move a genuine email to spam folder too.

# Algorithm used:
## Logistic Regression
