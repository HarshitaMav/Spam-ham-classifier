## About the project
We used previously collected data in order to train the model and predicted the category for new incoming emails. 
Here we used the labelled dataset this helped in understanding the importance of tagging the data in right way.
This process can help a lot of other people who are receiving the same kind of email but not aware of what spam is. Sometimes wrong spam tag can move a genuine email to spam folder too.

## Algorithm used:
## Logistic Regression:

Logistic regression is a supervised learning classification algorithm used to predict the probability of a target variable. The nature of target or dependent variable is dichotomous, which means there would be only two possible classes.

In simple words, the dependent variable is binary in nature having data coded as either 1 (stands for success/yes) or 0 (stands for failure/no).

Mathematically, a logistic regression model predicts P(Y=1) as a function of X. 

Here our classification is dependent variable on factors like various words used in mails and the labels in the dataset used for training.

1. This project is done using Logisic Regresssion by 3 different ways.
2. This project also visaulizes the data i.e. Number of spam and ham mails and some graphs.
3. Finally there are 2 word clouds for ham and spam words used respectively.
